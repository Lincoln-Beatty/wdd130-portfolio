    <h2>✅ Client Report</h2>
    <strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong>
    <p>I picked ideas I liked and found images that matched the theme. I didn’t always explain things clearly to the team.</p>

    <strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues?</strong>
    <p>We mostly messaged, but communication was slow. Sometimes my feedback wasn’t understood.</p>

    <strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong>
    <p>Yes, but it took a few changes to get there.</p>

    <strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team?</strong>
    <p>Give clearer instructions and check in more often.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <strong>How did you manage your team and give tasks?</strong>
    <p>I split the work and used Google Docs and GitHub. Some parts weren’t clear, so things got confused.</p>

    <strong>How did you talk to the client? Any issues?</strong>
    <p>Yes, they weren’t always clear or available. That slowed us down.</p>

    <strong>How did you publish and share the site?</strong>
    <p>I used GitHub Pages and sent them the link.</p>

    <strong>How was managing GitHub?</strong>
    <p>It was okay, but we had some merge problems that I had to fix.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <strong>How did you talk to your team lead? Any issues?</strong>
    <p>One team was clear, the other wasn’t. I sometimes waited a long time for replies.</p>

    <strong>Did you know what to do for each site?</strong>
    <p>One team gave clear tasks. The others were confusing.</p>

    <strong>Were you able to help on your sites?</strong>
    <p>Yes, I worked on HTML, CSS, and layout parts.</p>

    <strong>Any problems with GitHub?</strong>
    <p>Yes, pushing changes and merge conflicts were tricky at first.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ General Experience and Reflections</h2>
    <strong>Most challenging part?</strong>
    <p>Communication. It was hard across all teams. I asked questions to fix it.</p>

    <strong>What did you enjoy most?</strong>
    <p>Seeing finished sites and working with different people.</p>

    <strong>What would you do differently?</strong>
    <p>Use better tools to talk, like group chats or Trello.</p>

    <strong>Do you feel more confident now?</strong>
    <p>Yes. I learned how real teamwork works and how to improve next time.</p>
