    <h2> Client Report</h2>
    <strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong>
    <p>I picked photos from of google that machted my site plan theme.</p>

    <strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues?</strong>
    <p>A email or two. Sometimes my feedback wasnâ€™t understood, so I had to reclarify. But it went alright.</p>

    <strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong>
    <p>Yes, but it took a few changes to get there.</p>

    <strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team?</strong>
    <p>Give clearer instructions and check in more often.</p>

    <h2> Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <strong>How did you manage your team and give tasks?</strong>
    <p> I emailed them to get them connected to github, but they weren't forthcoming with taking a webpage to develop. I should have assigned them for clearities sake.</p>

    <strong>How did you talk to the client? Any issues?</strong>
    <p>No, but I think it was ok.</p>

    <strong>How did you publish and share the site?</strong>
    <p>I used GitHub Pages and sent them the link.</p>

    <strong>How was managing GitHub?</strong>
    <p>It was okay, but a little confusing sometimes with added people to the repository.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <strong>How did you talk to your team lead? Any issues?</strong>
    <p>In person was the best way to talk, but email sometimes works. We had some late replies and confused emails.</p>

    <strong>Did you know what to do for each site?</strong>
    <p>Not at first, but when I talked with them I understood</p>

    <strong>Were you able to help on your sites?</strong>
    <p>Yes, I worked on HTML, CSS, and layout parts.</p>

    <strong>Any problems with GitHub?</strong>
    <p>Yes, making sure I had access was difficult at first.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> General Experience and Reflections</h2>
    <strong>Most challenging part?</strong>
    <p>Communication. And understanding how to make the wireframe work.</p>

    <strong>What did you enjoy most?</strong>
    <p>Seeing finished sites and understanding how to fix problems in the code.</p>

    <strong>What would you do differently?</strong>
    <p>I would communicate better and make friends instead of being a loner.</p>

    <strong>Do you feel more confident now?</strong>
    <p>Yes. I learned how to create and modify a website; especialy with grids.</p>
