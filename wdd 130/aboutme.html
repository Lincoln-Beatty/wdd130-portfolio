                <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!</h2>
                <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Lincoln Beatty (also known as Brother Beatty). Iâ€™m passionate about learning new things, solving problems creatively, and helping others along the way. Whether Iâ€™m coding, playing games, or working on a new project, I always try to put my heart into everything I do. This page is a little window into my interests and what drives me.</p>

                <h2>ðŸ’» Coding & Engineering</h2>
                <p>I've always loved technology and the possibilities it opens up. I enjoy working on apps, building programs in C# and Python, and developing web applications. Creating solutions that make life easier or more fun is what excites me most about programming. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve my skills, learn new languages, and explore different aspects of software development.</p>

                <h2>ðŸŽ® Gaming</h2>
                <p>Gaming has been a big part of my life and a great way to connect with friends and challenge myself. In League of Legends, I mainly play Viktor, Jinx, and Warwick, and recently Iâ€™ve been exploring support roles like Soraka and Janna. I also run a Minecraft YouTube channel focused on hardcore Let's Plays and creative challenges. Sharing my adventures and seeing how others interact with my builds and stories has been an amazing experience.</p>

                <h2>ðŸŽ§ Music & Tech</h2>
                <p>Alongside my love for coding and gaming, I have a deep interest in music and audio technology. Iâ€™ve worked as a sound tech, helping set up and run live events to ensure the best possible audio experience. I enjoy learning about new equipment, experimenting with mixing, and finding ways to make sound clear and impactful. Itâ€™s another creative outlet that lets me blend technical skills with artistic expression.</p>

                <h2>ðŸŒŽ Mission & Values</h2>
                <p>Serving a mission taught me the importance of hard work, patience, and compassion. It helped me grow spiritually and personally, and those lessons continue to shape how I approach life today. I strive to be someone who uplifts others, contributes positively to my community, and always keeps learning and growing.</p>
