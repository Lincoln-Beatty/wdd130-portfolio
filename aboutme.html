                <h2>👋 Welcome!</h2>
                <p>Hi! I’m Lincoln Beatty (also known as Brother Beatty). I’m passionate about learning new things, solving problems creatively, and helping others along the way. Whether I’m coding, playing games, or working on a new project, I always try to put my heart into everything I do. This page is a little window into my interests and what drives me.</p>

                <h2>💻 Coding & Engineering</h2>
                <p>I've always loved technology and the possibilities it opens up. I enjoy working on apps, building programs in C# and Python, and developing web applications. Creating solutions that make life easier or more fun is what excites me most about programming. I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills, learn new languages, and explore different aspects of software development.</p>

                <h2>🎮 Gaming</h2>
                <p>Gaming has been a big part of my life and a great way to connect with friends and challenge myself. In League of Legends, I mainly play Viktor, Jinx, and Warwick, and recently I’ve been exploring support roles like Soraka and Janna. I also run a Minecraft YouTube channel focused on hardcore Let's Plays and creative challenges. Sharing my adventures and seeing how others interact with my builds and stories has been an amazing experience.</p>

                <h2>🎧 Music & Tech</h2>
                <p>Alongside my love for coding and gaming, I have a deep interest in music and audio technology. I’ve worked as a sound tech, helping set up and run live events to ensure the best possible audio experience. I enjoy learning about new equipment, experimenting with mixing, and finding ways to make sound clear and impactful. It’s another creative outlet that lets me blend technical skills with artistic expression.</p>

                <h2>🌎 Mission & Values</h2>
                <p>Serving a mission taught me the importance of hard work, patience, and compassion. It helped me grow spiritually and personally, and those lessons continue to shape how I approach life today. I strive to be someone who uplifts others, contributes positively to my community, and always keeps learning and growing.</p>
